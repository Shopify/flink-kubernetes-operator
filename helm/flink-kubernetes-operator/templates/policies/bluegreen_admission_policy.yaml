ValidatingAdmissionPolicy to prevent direct modifications to FlinkDeployments
that are managed by a FlinkBlueGreenDeployment.

This policy uses CEL expressions evaluated by the Kubernetes API server directly,
requiring no webhook server. Requires Kubernetes 1.30+ (GA) or 1.26+ (beta with
feature gate enabled).

When a user tries to UPDATE a FlinkDeployment that has an ownerReference to a
FlinkBlueGreenDeployment, the request is denied unless it comes from the
operator's service account.
